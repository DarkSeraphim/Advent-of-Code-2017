# Day 3
## Scala

### Time taken: 

5 hours, including reading about it, accidentally throwing away my code once, and breaking Chrome (writing code online on a phone is not something I'd recommend)

### Language Experience:

1 [See this link for explaination](https://github.com/DarkSeraphim/Advent-of-Code-2017#language-experience-scale)

### Lessons learned:

Scala is a nice language. Coming from Java, the first hour was a bit strange, but you get used to it quickly.
