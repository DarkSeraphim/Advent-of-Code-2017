# Day 2
## Haskell

### Time taken: 

A whole day of thinking, probably several hours of actually writing

### Language Experience:

2 (only done intro) [See this link for explaination](https://github.com/DarkSeraphim/Advent-of-Code-2017#language-experience-scale)

### Lessons learned:

Holy f*cking hell Haskell (thanks @okkero, you're a life saver)
Its pretty damn hard writing without state, when used to state. I should spend more time with functional programming.
